 * Created by manishgiri on 1/29/17.
 * implementation of a circular queue where the REAR wraps around the FRONT to improve efficiency
 * In a NON CIRCULAR queue, if a few items are deleted from the top, FRONT moves up, and when REAR is
 * at the max capacity, no more items can be added to the queue even though there is room
